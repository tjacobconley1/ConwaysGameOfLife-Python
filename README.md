IN PROGRESS

Here is my current attempt at solving Conway's Game of Life using Python

The 2Darray will hold the HIGH or LOW value for each point on the grid

I think I can use 2 .png files formatted correctly in a gui somehow as panels

The visable solution will be using each iteration of for loops as a frame
